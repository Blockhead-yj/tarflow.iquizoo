Description: For "iquizoo" data processing, there is already a package
    called "dataproc.iquizoo", but eventually the use of it is relied on a
    workflow. This package is used to build such workflows based on tools
    provided by "targets" package which mimicks the logic of "make",
    automating the building processes.
