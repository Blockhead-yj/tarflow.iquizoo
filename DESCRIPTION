Description: For "iquizoo" data processing, there is already a
    package called "dataproc.iquizoo", but eventually the use of it is
    relied on a workflow.  This package is used to build such workflows
    based on tools provided by "targets". The "targets" is a package
    mimicking the logic of "make", automating the building processes.
