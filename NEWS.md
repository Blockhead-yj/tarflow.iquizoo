# tarflow.iquizoo (development version)

* Fix the encoding issue on Windows system.
* Add new schema "original" to download original data only.
* Use a new yaml configurations api.
* Support more types of `config_where` in `fetch_from_v3()`. Besides the `list` type, now you can specify a `data.frame` type and even a `character` type of `config_where`. This is most helpful when `config_where` is generated not by `yaml` config, but by R code directly.
* Rename `fetch_from_v3()` as `fetch()`, and the API is now `fetch(query_file, config_where, dsn)`. That is to say, you can now pass the data source name of your database to it.
* Export S3 method `compose_where()`, which originally was named as `compose_where_clause()`.
* Support new argument `separate` in `use_targets()` to optionally separate fetching into branches by games.
* Moved internal data named `game_info` to "dataproc.iquizoo (>= 0.2.6)" package.

# tarflow.iquizoo 0.0.0.9001

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
